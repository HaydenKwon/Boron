Why organic Boron is likely a panacea/essential nutrient + related thoughts

-Roughly 25% decline in testosterone over 25 years even after controlling for weight, boron seems to roughly reverse that(low samples) -> points to essential nutrient deficiency

-Vitamin D and magnesium seem to be the most common nutrient deficiencies with seemingly no understanding of why, supplementation does not seem to help either. Boron interacts heavily with both these things.

-Last measurement of boron in foods was done in 2000s, could be drastically lower now

- If it was studied well it would not be something that had potential, hence why i am writing this, the small amount of research done is extremely promising

-Most widespread crop deficiency

-All autoimmune diseases seem to respond to antibiotic or ketogenic treatment somewhat implying a large intestinal link, even diseases not considered autoimmune but respond to keto or antibiotics should experiment with boron

-Inorganic boron forms donâ€™t seem to have the effect on intestines that organic boron does

-Largest evidence for effectiveness in autoimmunity is the tight time frames in which I reduced my symptoms(ankylosing spondylitis) then increased them by cutting my fructoborate intake then subsequently decreased them, all of this within the span of weeks

-My theory on preventing autoimmunity is that it either repairs the intestinal mucosal barrier or maintains some sort of homeostasis in the microbiome preventing leakage(prebiotic action)

-remember bayesian thinking relies both on sample size as well as effect magnitude

-Dosages in human studies are too low, the recommended maximum of 20 mg derived from a rat study is terribly low, studies done on pigs have 10-100x the dosage and no adverse effects, note I have also taken very large dosages with no adverse effects

-Autoimmunity seems closely related to allergies, likely the same intestinal action where leakage in the gut creates immune reactivity elsewhere, my light allergy symptoms have disappeared on fructoborate(sinusitis, dust allergy)

-This is something entirely unknown on the alternative health side aside from the rex newnham studies on inorganic boron(ineffective I think), only loosely studied in academic health, it is not a commonly purchased supplement nor is there much internet discussion on it

-Intestinal/microbiome link to autoimmunity is very new and not well studied

-fairly high inflammation marker reduction in rheumatoid arthritis studies(note that dosage is likely too low for full remission)



 
-Mental health seems to be mostly an intestinal issue given recent studies(limited ofc medicine is so slow) as well as the remission of my own mental symptoms after taking fructoborate(adhd, depression, mania)


-also seems related to bone formation/coordination of growth examples include c section, jaw and tooth differences between hunter gatherer and agrarian populations(weak link but women with ankylosing spondylitis have c sections at a fairly high rate, also c sections having such a high rate makes no sense evolutionararily and points to nutrient deficiency) One of the hallmarks of an agrarian diet is the lack of boron in the stable foods(corn, rice)
